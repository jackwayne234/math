    PART 1: KNOW YOUR TOOLS
############################################################

For each one — describe the formula or law in your own
words, say WHEN you'd reach for it, and WHY it works.
No need to solve anything. Just talk about it.


------------------------------------------------------------
ALGEBRA
------------------------------------------------------------

1. SLOPE-INTERCEPT FORM

   Write the formula:


   What does it tell you?


   When would you use it?


   Why does it work?



2. SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS

   What are you actually doing when you solve a system?


   When would you use substitution vs elimination?


   How do you know if the system has no solution or
   infinite solutions?

   a)

   b)

   c)

   Why do these rules work? (What's the deeper reason?)



4. ZERO AND NEGATIVE EXPONENTS

   What does x^0 equal and why?


   What does x^(-n) mean and why?



5. FRACTIONAL EXPONENTS & RADICALS

   What does x^(1/2) mean? Why?


   What does x^(2/3) mean? (Which part is the root,
   which part is the power?)


   When would you convert between radical and exponent
   form? Why bother?

   a)

   b)

   How do you find the domain when you see each one?



7. INVERSE FUNCTIONS

11. THE DISCRIMINANT

    Write the formula:


    What does it tell you?

    Positive means:

    Zero means:

    Negative means:

    Why does this work? (What's it doing inside the
    quadratic formula?)



12. COMPLETING THE SQUARE

    Describe the procedure in your own words:


    Why do you halve the middle coefficient and square it?
    (What are you reverse-engineering?)


    When would you use this instead of the quadratic
    formula?

    Write all three rules and explain why each one works:

    a)


    b)


    c)


    Which one lets you solve exponential equations, and how?



15. CHANGE OF BASE FORMULA

    Write the formula:


    When do you need this?


    Why does it work? (The measuring stick analogy)



------------------------------------------------------------
TRIG
------------------------------------------------------------

16. SINE, COSINE, AND TANGENT

    Describe each one using the unit circle (not just
    SOH-CAH-TOA):

    sin(θ) =

    cos(θ) =

    tan(θ) =

    Where does tangent blow up, and why?



17. RADIANS

    What IS a radian?


    Why do mathematicians prefer radians over degrees?


    Conversion: to go from degrees to radians, you...

    To go from radians to degrees, you...



18. PYTHAGOREAN IDENTITY

    Write the formula:


    Where does this come from? (What theorem, applied
    to what?)


    When would you use this?



19. LAW OF SINES

    Write the formula:


    Where does it come from? (The two-right-triangles
    idea)


    When would you use this?


    Why did you decide to use this over SOH-CAH-TOA?



20. INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONS

    What do they do? (What goes in, what comes out?)


    When would you use one?


    Why do they have a restricted domain?
